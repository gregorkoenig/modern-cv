about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  Hi, I am a professional, self-motivated, and open-minded person with experience as engineering manager, software engineer, international project manager, and lecturer. I am passionate about technology and developing amazing solutions together with like-minded people. It is highly rewarding to support people in their professional journey and help them grown, thrive and prosper. 
  
  My technological focus lies on the research and development of secure communication and connectivity, (bio-)signal-processing, safety-critical embedded real-time systems, and their application in different fields. 
  
  I love science and I hold a PhD in Biomedical Engineering.

             At the AIT I had the opportunity to work on my PhD research as a scientist in the field of bio-signal processing for medical devices. I also worked on other safety-critical aspects of medical products. During these four years I finished my PhD thesis at the Medical University of Vienna and was a lecturer at the Technical University of Vienna.

          During my time at Medical University if Vienna I did my PhD research in the field of bio-signal analysis (EEG, EOG, EMG) and the quantification of sleepiness and sleep quality. In 2012 I successfully finished my research and defended my [PhD thesis](https://www.amazon.de/EEG-based-Model-Daytime-Vigilance-Trends/dp/3838150848).
